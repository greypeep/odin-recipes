    <h1>Strawberry fondue </h1>
    <p>In this recipe we will learn how to make an amazing delicious strawberry fondue</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>23-ounce container of frozen strawberries</li>
    <li> 2 tablespoons of maraschino cherry juice.</li>
    <li> 2 teaspoons of cornstarch</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of cold water</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Recipe</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Begin by placing the frozen strawberries in a food processor or blender, and mix until they are all pureed. Then, transfer the mixture to a medium saucepan. </li>
    <li>In a separate small bowl, combine the cornstarch and water, whisk and then stir it into the strawberry puree.</li>
    <li>Proceed to bring the strawberry mixture to a boil, cook and stir for 1-2 minutes while boiling or until thickened. Next, stir in the cherry juice and then remove from the heat.</li>
    <li>This fondue is wonderful warm, but let it cool for just a few minutes before transferring to a serving bowl. </li>
    <li>Pair with your choice of dipping food â€“ we love this fondue with pieces of angel food cake, bananas and brownies! You can also dip rice krispie treats, marshmallows, fruit (mandarin oranges, raspberries, kiwis, etc) and pretty much anything that is chocolate.</li>
